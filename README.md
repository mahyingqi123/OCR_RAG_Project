# OCR_RAG_Project
A POC project demonstrating RAG and OCR

Use Case: AI-Powered Knowledge Base Assistant (PoC) utilising organisation's Internal Document(s)

Problem Statement: A wide range of valuable information is stored across various internal documents and policies. Accessing the right information quickly becomes increasingly challenging when the volume grows. To improve efficiency and empower internal agents with faster, precise and accurate access to relevant knowledge, we are building an AI solution that leverages these documents to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses through a proof-of-concept (PoC) assistant.
